Yes, TDD Kata 1 - String Calculator is a popular coding exercise designed to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles. The exercise involves implementing a simple string calculator that can take a string of numbers and return their sum. Here's a breakdown of the typical steps involved:

\*\*Create a simple String calculator with a method add(String numbers).

The method can take 0, 1, or 2 numbers and will return their sum (for example, add("1,2") should return 3).
Empty string should return 0.
\*\*Allow the add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers.

For example, add("1,2,3,4") should return 10.
\*\*Allow the add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
